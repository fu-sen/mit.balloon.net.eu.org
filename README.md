I often write simple one-file programs, so even this is difficult to paste in long sentences.\
So The MIT License had a different URL and pasted it in the program comments.\ These have long been published on GitHub Gist.

[GitHub Gist @fu-sen](https://gist.github.com/fu-sen)

However, I have published many programs and it has become difficult to find the programs and the appropriate MIT license from Gist.
Therefore, some programs and the MIT license were individually projected.

It uses JavaScript and the year can be changed freely, It's easy to create URLs.

I dared to adopt the free domain [EU.org](https://www.eu.org/), It is designed so that it can be referenced even after a few years.
